What if a component receives inconsistent data?
- Showing error message on screen for client

What if the schedule has no port calls?
What if the schedule has no orders?
- Depend on the use case, message or warning could be show 

How can the UI be improved?
- Different color for different event. In the code, I implemented 
  orange for Idle or Ballast as they can be consider "wasteful"

And etc
